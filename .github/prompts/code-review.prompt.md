# Code Review Prompt

Review the test files in the current workspace, focusing on:

1. **Syntax & Correctness**: Check for any syntax errors or type issues
2. **Pytest-Playwright Best Practices**: Ensure proper async/await, selectors, and wait strategies
3. **Architecture Compliance**: Verify adherence to page object model and component patterns
4. **Test Quality**: Assess assertions, error handling, and test reliability
5. **Coverage Analysis**: Identify missing test scenarios or edge cases

Provide structured feedback with:
- Critical issues that must be fixed
- High priority improvements for reliability
- Medium priority code quality suggestions
- Positive feedback on well-implemented patterns

Format your review with clear action items and code examples where applicable.
